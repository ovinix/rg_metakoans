# Metakoans

Metakoans is an arduous set of exercises designed to stretch
meta-programming muscle.  the focus is on a single method 'attribute' which
behaves much like the built-in 'attr', but whose properties require delving
deep into the depths of meta-ruby.  usage of the 'attribute' method follows
the general form of

``` 
  class C
    attribute 'a'
  end
 
  o = C::new
  o.a = 42  # setter - sets @a
  o.a       # getter - gets @a
  o.a?      # query - true if @a
```
 
but reaches much farther than the standard 'attr' method as you will see
shortly.
 
Your path, should you choose to follow it, is to write a single file
'knowledge.rb' implementing all functionality required by the koans below.
as a student of meta-programming your course will be guided by a guru whose
wisdom and pithy sayings will assist you on your journey.
 
a successful student will eventually be able to do this  

```sh
